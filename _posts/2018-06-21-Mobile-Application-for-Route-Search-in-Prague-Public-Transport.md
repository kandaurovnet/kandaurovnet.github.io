### Abstract

This thesis deals with the shortest path problem in a time-dependent directed weighted multigraph. An example of such graph is a public transport network built with GTFS data. The aim of the thesis is to design data structure and algorithm for routes search in transport networks and design optimizations to improve route search process. The result is an offline mobile application for public transport route search in Prague.

**Keywords:** Public transport, Time-dependent graph, Shortest path problem algorithms, GTFS
